# discord_bot

# Mostly I'm just making a fun bot for Discord with whatever features come to mind.  As of now there are some fun commands, including commands to obtain current stock and crypto prices.  

#You'll have to obtain your own API tokens from Discord and Coinbase and add them in a .env file to make this work.  Add the tokens to a .env file called discord_py_env.env.  To make the code work as-is.  Otherwise you'll have to change references in the code to match the name of your .env file in addition to obtaining tokens.
